                    <p>Certain email services providers can also block emails containing links.
                        In particular, icloud.com reportedly blocks such emails. Unfortunately,
                        there is little we can do about it. If possible, please try a different
                        email address.

                <label>Why are the fees such weird-looking numbers?

                </label>
                <section>
                    <p>The fees are tied to the price of Siacoin. As the exchange rate of
                        Siacoin fluctuates, so do the fees.
